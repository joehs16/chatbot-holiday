## Amazon Lex

Amazon Lex is Amazon's service for building conversational bots or "chatbots" and provides automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text. It also integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, including AWS CloudWatch, Cognito, and Lambda. This allows developers to built a more customized and effective chatbot that best fits their needs.

Our project uses Amazon Lex to build a chatbot that can help book hotels and cars for a trip. Test it out [here](https://dr5p7ego6gbjc.cloudfront.net/index.html)!
